# terraform-infra

Where I keep terraform infrastructure layouts.
Like a lot of other people out there, I find the namespace scoping / file layout issues of the terraform module system too restrictive.
So, like a lot of other people, I'm evaluating jinja2 templates with variables populated from a YAML file to generate the HCL templates that then get run.
